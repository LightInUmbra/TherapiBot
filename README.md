# TherapiBot
This is a small chat bot I made using python to work under the command line. It opens as an EXE file format, and is used to provide help for the user whenever in a state of negativity.

The purpose of this "Chat Bot" is for the user to get help, as well as to express their emotions with the comfort of privacy; no one has to know what they express, and they choose whether they would like to save their "Venting Session" or not. If they [The User] chooses not to disclose anything to the bot, there are preset options. This was made with the intention of helping college and high school students that are undergoing problems in relation to suicide, depression, and no self-confidence. This was only an idea I had for my local hackathon, and I do plan to update this chat bot and make it more useable. I hope this chat bot helps anyone that needs it. It isn't my best work, but I'm proud of it.
